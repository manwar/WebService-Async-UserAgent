# ABSTRACT: HTTP useragent abstraction for webservices

=head1 NAME

WebService::Async::UserAgent - common API for making HTTP requests to webservices

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use WebService::Async::UserAgent::NaHTTP;
 my $ua = WebService::Async::UserAgent::NaHTTP->new(loop => $loop);
 eval {
  print "was OK" if $ua->get('...')->get->code == 200;
 } or warn "Failed - $@";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an early release, most things are undocumented and subject to change.

The intention is to provide an abstraction for webservice API calls without
hardcoding a dependency on a specific HTTP client (such as L<Net::Async::HTTP>).
Although there is very basic support for sync clients such as L<LWP::UserAgent>,
they are untested and only there as an example. That may change in future.
